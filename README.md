# Hi Sezzle,

## Installation.
`npm install`, `npm start`. Open http://localhost:8088

## Testing
run `npm test`. And it loads cypress testing interface in headless chrome
In the testing interface, under the integration tests section, click on index.js under calculator
I wrote some sample tests in cypress/integration/calculator/index.js
